# DiverSim

**DiverSim** is an innovative simulating tool to generate **synthetic pedestrian data** with a focus on **diversity** and inclusion. Built on Unreal Engine 5, DiverSim creates balanced datasets featuring equal proportions of **genders, ethnicities**, and individuals with **disabilities**. Users can customize various simulation parameters, including atmospheric conditions, **fisheye camera** parameters and characteristics of the pedestrians, while data is annotated in **ASAM OpenLABEL** format. As an open-source tool, DiverSim enables researchers and developers to train and validate AI models that effectively represent diverse pedestrian scenarios.

## How To Use
To understand how to perform a recording with the DiverSim tool, please refer to the *example_record.py* script. This script outlines the essential simulation parameters, specifies the path to the executable (see links below), and designates the save location for the output data. It effectively manages the execution of the simulator, configures the simulation settings, and captures and annotates the generated data.
